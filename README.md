# Cuadratic
This is a basic project I made to practice slicing, classes, and mutable data storage. It basically a quadratic function as input (needs to be ordered) and returns either the roots (Cuadratic.roots()), the vertex (Cuadratic.vertex) or the symmetry axis (Cuadratic.saxis()). The input has to follow two specific input rules: 1. each term needs to be separated by a space so it can be recognized and 2. the exponent symbol to be used is "^" instead of "**".
